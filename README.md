# Quadruped Control Library
A library to implement quadruped control based on the paper "Carlo, Jared &amp; Wensing, Patrick &amp; Katz, Benjamin &amp; Bledt, Gerardo &amp; Kim, Sangbae. (2018). Dynamic Locomotion in the MIT Cheetah 3 Through Convex Model-Predictive Control. 1-9. 10.1109/IROS.2018.8594448"

This library's implementation is highly influenced by the [MIT Cheetah Software](https://github.com/mit-biomimetics/Cheetah-Software)
